    Long: `Usage: dfi [flags] sources... dest

Sources should be a list of (non-recursive) globs, files, and directories whose
contents should be symlinked into dest. The contents of directories are noted
with a trailing '/' on the path. To link a directory itself, omit the trailing
slash.

SOURCES:

    foo*    -> files beginning with 'foo'
    a/dir/  -> contents of 'a/dir'
    a/dir   -> create a link to 'dir' itself in dest

For info on the supported glob syntax, see https://github.com/gobwas/glob

MOTIVATION:

The purpose of this utility is to keep configuration files and directories
under source control in a single directory, then symlink them into place.
This program will by default look in the current working directory for a
directory named 'dotfiles', and will create symlinks to all of them in the
parent of the current directory with a '.' prepended.

$HOME/
  .settings/
    dotfiles/
      bashrc
      bash_profile
      zshrc
      ssh/
        config

if you cd into '~/.settings' and run dotinstall it will create the following symlinks:

$HOME/
  .bashrc -> .settings/dotfiles/bashrc
  .bash_profile -> .settings/dotfiles/bash_profile
  .zshrc -> .settings/dotfiles/zshrc
  .ssh -> .settings/dotfiles/ssh

Additionally, it can install links under a 'bin' directory, where the '.' prefix
is not applied. This is useful when you have a number of shell scripts and want
to link them from your version controllled directory into a location in your PATH.

$HOME/
  .settings/
    bin/
      foo
      bar
      baz

can be linked to

$HOME/
  .local/
    bin/
      foo -> ../../.settings/bin/foo
      bar -> ../../.settings/bin/bar
      baz -> ../../.settings/bin/baz

In the case of conflicts (i.e. destination already exists) you can decide
how files and symlinks will be handled.

If a link path already exists, the following strategies are available:

* 'backup': move the file to a unique dated backup location and create the symlink

* 'replace': just delete the file and create the symlink

* 'warn': print a warning that the conflict exists and continue.

* 'fail': stop processing and report an error.

EXAMPLES:

create symlinks for all files in 'dotfiles' in the home directory, with a '.' prefix
for each symlink name. i.e. ~/.bashrc -> .settings/dotfiles/bashrc

  $ dfi -p . ~/.settings/dotfiles/ ~/

create symlinks for all files in 'bin' under ~/.local/bin.
eg. ~/.local/bin/foo -> ../../.settings/bin/foo

  $ dfi ~/.settings/bin/ ~/.local/bin
