Sources should be a list of paths that should have symlinks created in
dest. Note that the case of duplicate filenames (which would create
two sources to the same symlink) is considered an error. Sources can
also be '-' which means to read source paths from stdin, one per line,
or if the -z flag is given, separated by null bytes.

In the case of conflicts (i.e. destination already exists) you can decide
how files and symlinks will be handled.

If a link path already exists, the following strategies are available:

* 'rename': move the file to a unique dated location and create the symlink

* 'replace': just delete the file and create the symlink

* 'warn': print a warning that the conflict exists and continue.

* 'fail': stop processing and report an error.
