// rootCmd represents the base command when called without any subcommands
var rootCmd = &cobra.Command{
  Use:   "dfi",
  Short: "Manages dotfile symlinks to version-controlled files",
  Long: `The purpose of this utility is to keep configuration files and directories
  under source control in a single directory, then symlink them into place.
  This program will by default look in the current working directory for a
  directory named 'dotfiles', and will create symlinks to all of them in the
  parent of the current directory with a '.' prepended.

  $HOME/
    .settings/
      dotfiles/
        bashrc
        bash_profile
        zshrc
        ssh/
          config

  if you cd into '~/.settings' and run dotinstall it will create the following symlinks:

  $HOME/
    .bashrc -> .settings/dotfiles/bashrc
    .bash_profile -> .settings/dotfiles/bash_profile
    .zshrc -> .settings/dotfiles/zshrc
    .ssh -> .settings/dotfiles/ssh

  Additionally, it can install links under a 'bin' directory, where the '.' prefix
  is not applied. This is useful when you have a number of shell scripts and want
  to link them from your version controllled directory into a location in your PATH.

  $HOME/
    .settings/
      bin/
        foo
        bar
        baz

  can be linked to

  $HOME/
    .local/
      bin/
        foo -> ../../.settings/bin/foo
        bar -> ../../.settings/bin/bar
        baz -> ../../.settings/bin/baz

  In the case of conflicts (i.e. destination already exists) you can decide
  how files and symlinks will be handled.

  If a link path already exists and is a file, the following strategies are available:

  * 'backup': move the file to a unique dated backup location and create the symlink

  * 'replace': just delete the file and create the symlink

  * 'warn': print a warning that the conflict exists and continue.

  * 'fail': stop processing and report an error.

  If a symlink exists:

  * 'replace': assume we own the symlink and recreate it pointing to the target

  * 'warn': print a warning that the conflict exists and continue

  * 'fail': stop processing and report an error`,

  // has an action associated with it:

// This is called by main.main(). It only needs to happen once to the rootCmd.

  // Cobra supports persistent flags, which, if defined here,
  // will be global for your application.

  // Cobra also supports local flags, which will only run
  // when this action is called directly.

}


// initConfig reads in config file and ENV variables if set.

  if cfgFile != "" {
    // Use config file from the flag.
